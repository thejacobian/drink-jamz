Concept: Visitors to the site can login to their Spotify, etc account and stream songs either free or paid. The website will search a database/API of cocktails and recommend pairings based on hometown of artist and other attributes of the artists' musical style or perhaps track attributes from Spotify API.

## MVP:
1. Visitors can search for an Artist via the landing page search box if they do not want to use the player
2. Visitors will see a cocktail recipe from CocktailDB API on the Results page derived from the Artist's attributes like hometown and genre.
3. Visitors can Search Again to randomly generate a different cocktail.

## Extras:
1. Include embedded Spotify web player
2. Optimize for mobile operation
3. Implement users to save favorite cocktails
4. Allow user to select a base alcohol and ingredient from a drop-down for more personalized recipes
5. Stretch goal - Potentially recommend an artist from an alcohol and ingredient and genre?
6. Super stretch goal - implement MusixMatch API to search all band lyrics to improve relationship algorithm
7. Only if lots of time left goal - implement Pandora, Deezer, Prime Music, Apple Music, etc integration
